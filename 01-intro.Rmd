# The Basics {#basics}

This is going to be a short book that introduces the reader to the wonderful world of **Pokemon** and the starters in each game.

In every Pokemon game, the player starts with one of three Pokemon, usually a grass, water, or fire type. This first Pokemon is called the **starter**.

Each starter has 6 different base stats, meaning each has strengths and weaknesses. Here are some tables that show the base stats of each Gen 1 starter: Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle.

The first graph is **hit points** or **HP**, which is how much damage the Pokemon can take.

```{r nice-fig1, fig.cap='HP values for Gen 1 Starters', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(hitpoints)
```

Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively.

```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)
```

Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab).

```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

```{r nice-tab2, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

You can write citations, too.Or, if you don't know what you're doing, ask Dr. Macfarlane for help. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].
